                    distributed data processing & feature engineering that came along with this. On top of that I have

                    of how software services are deployed by being responsible for the infrastructure around it.
                    Specifically here I was working closely with our on-premise servers integrated with Kubernetes,
                    creating automated deployment pipelines, and managing infrastructure tools around these such as
